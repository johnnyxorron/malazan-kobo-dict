I wanted to use TheFictionary.net's brilliant Fictionaries for Malazan Book of the Fallen on my Kobo but couldn't find an option anywhere so I converted them myself and thought I'd share because the process wasn't exactly simple, especially for most people. All credit for the creation of the original dictionaries goes to David Byard and TheFictionary.net. I am not affiliated with TheFictionary.net, I just wanted to make it easier for my fellow Kobo users.

Go support the work they do at [TheFictionary](thefictionary.net).

To comply with the Kobo dictionary naming conventions the files are named dicthtml-mz (mz for Malazan) and then two letters denoting the title of the book.

Therefore the names go as follows:

dicthtml-mz-gm: Gardens of the Moon

dicthtml-mz-dg: Deadhouse Gates

dicthtml-mz-mi: Memories of Ice

dicthtml-mz-hc: House of Chains

dicthtml-mz-mt: Midnight Tides

dicthtml-mz-bh: The Bonehunters

dicthtml-mz-rg: Reaper's Gale

dicthtml-mz-th: Toll the Hounds

dicthtml-mz-dd: Dust of Dreams

dicthtml-mz-cg: The Crippled God
